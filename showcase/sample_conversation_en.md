### Round 1

Mayor: *Smiles and shakes Li Hua's hand* Li Hua, your attire is strikingly impressive. It’s evident you're a forward-thinking businessman. Welcome to our town. How may I assist you?

Li Hua: *Smiles back and shakes the Mayor's hand* Mayor, thank you for the warm welcome. I’m here with the hope of investing in an advanced hospital to improve local medical facilities, offer high-quality medical services, and also create local employment opportunities to boost community economic development. I hope for your support and assistance.

Mayor: *Nods in agreement* Li Hua, that’s a wonderful idea; our town does need a state-of-the-art hospital. I will fully support your plan and assist you in finding an appropriate location in town. Let's contribute together to the prosperity of our community.

Li Hua: *Smiles and nods* Thank you for your support and assistance, Mayor. I believe our collaboration will bring significant improvements to the town. I'll commence preparations soon, and hope to see the establishment of the new hospital in the near future.

### Round 2

Mayor: *Smiles and shakes Li Hua's hand* Li Hua, it's a pleasure to see you again. I look forward to our detailed discussions on the hospital project.

Li Hua: *Shakes the Mayor’s hand and smiles* Mayor, it's good to see you too. I've prepared some initial plans regarding the hospital construction.

Mayor: *Nods in agreement, then says* Excellent, Li Hua. I trust your plans are well-thought-out. Could you share your initial ideas?

Li Hua: *Presents a document to the Mayor, then says* This is my preliminary plan. I hope to place the hospital in the central area of the town for easy access. I've also considered future expansions, thus requiring a sufficiently large piece of land.

Mayor: *Examines the document, then says* Your plans are well-rounded, Li Hua. The central area is indeed a good location, but we also need to consider traffic and noise concerns. I'll help you find a suitable piece of land shortly.

Li Hua: *Nods in understanding, then says* I fully understand your concerns, Mayor. We’ll ensure the hospital's operations do not negatively impact the surrounding environment. I also look forward to your prompt identification of suitable land.

Mayor: *Smiles, then says* I trust your commitment, Li Hua. I'll liaise with relevant departments to find the right piece of land quickly. Also, we’ll closely monitor the progress of the hospital construction to ensure everything runs smoothly.

Li Hua: *Smiles, then says* I greatly appreciate your support and help, Mayor. I believe our collaboration will have a positive impact on the development of the town. I look forward to our next meeting, when I hope to hear good news about the land selection.

### Round 3

Mayor: *Walks up smiling, warmly shakes hands with Li Hua* Li Hua, it's great to see you again. I have already begun looking for suitable locations for the hospital construction. Let's discuss the hospital building plans once again.

Li Hua: *Shakes hands with the mayor, smiles and says* Mayor, it's great to see you again too. I look forward to hearing your suggestions on land selection. Let's discuss together how we can maximize the benefits to the community through the hospital's construction.

Mayor: *Thinks for a moment, then says* I believe we can consider building the hospital near the town center but far enough not to cause noise pollution for residents. This way, it's convenient for residents to seek medical help while ensuring their quality of life. What do you think?

Li Hua: *Nods in agreement, then says* I agree with you, Mayor. We need to find a location that's convenient for residents while not causing noise pollution. I trust that you'll find such a location.

Mayor: *Smiles and says* I already have a few locations in mind and will make a decision soon. We also need to consider the scale and facilities of the hospital to ensure it meets the needs of the townspeople.

Li Hua: *Thinks for a moment, then says* I agree, Mayor. The scale and facilities are important considerations. I hope our hospital can provide comprehensive medical services, including emergency care, surgery, and rehabilitation. We should also consider future expansion.

Mayor: *Nods in agreement, then says* Your thoughts are very comprehensive, Li Hua. I also agree on setting aside room for future expansion to meet potential growth in demand. I will find a suitable location as soon as possible to get our hospital up and running.

Li Hua: *Smiles and says* I trust your judgment, Mayor. I look forward to our hospital serving the community soon. I will closely monitor the progress on land selection and stand by for further preparations.

### Round 4

Mayor: *Walks up smiling, shakes hands with Li Hua* Li Hua, it's great to see you again. We have more details to discuss regarding the hospital construction.

Li Hua: *Firmly shakes hands with the Mayor, smiles back* Mayor, it's also great to see you again. I'm ready to discuss the details of the hospital construction, especially on the issue of land selection.

Mayor: *Nods in agreement, then begins talking* About land selection, we need to find a location that is both convenient for residents and doesn't affect their daily lives. I already have a few places in mind that we can go check out together.

Li Hua: *Nods in understanding, then starts speaking* I completely agree, Mayor. We need to find a location that's convenient for the residents without affecting their daily lives. I look forward to seeing the locations you have in mind.

Mayor: *Pulls out a map and points to a few locations* These are some of the places I've been considering. We can go on-site to see which location is best for the hospital.

Li Hua: *Looks at the map, points to one of the locations* This place is near the town center and convenient in terms of transportation, but we need to consider the noise issue. We can explore the possibilities for this location.

Mayor: *Nods in agreement, then starts speaking* Your consideration is very thoughtful, Li Hua. While the town center offers good transportation, noise pollution is something we must address. We can have professionals assess the situation to see if we can mitigate noise through design and construction techniques.

Li Hua: *Looks seriously at the Mayor, then starts speaking* Mayor, I completely agree with your suggestion. We can have professionals evaluate it, and my team will also look into ways to minimize noise through design and construction methods.

Mayor: *Smiles and nods, then starts speaking* Then it's settled, Li Hua. We'll arrange for professional assessments as soon as possible and keep close communication with your team. I look forward to getting our hospital built soon to provide better healthcare services for the townspeople.

Li Hua: *Smiles back at the Mayor* I also look forward to the hospital being built soon, Mayor. I believe our collaboration will bring better healthcare services to the community. My team will get started right away.
